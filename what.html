                    <h2>The Backstory</h2>

                    <p><span class="tag is-medium">As told by co-founder Patrick Lorenzut</span></p>

                    <p>I used to be a Machine Learning Engineer. Frankly, the immense capabilities in that field scare the crap out of me. And the future, if it remains in the hands of powerful people with chips on their shoulders who feel like they have things to prove and trophies to earn… the future is very, very scary IMO. I firmly believe that the most important thing that humanity needs to do right now is increase empathy and equity in tech. So that these immense capabilities are developed with good intentions.</p>

                    <p>I know what it’s like to be a privileged white guy who feels slighted despite having every advantage. I know what it’s like to feel like I have to choose between paying my bills and doing something meaningful. I know what it’s like to not only hate my unsatisfying job, but also to hate myself for not being able to be happy. And on a personal level, I know what it’s like to be married to the wrong person, to be living in the wrong city, to have friends that don’t know who I am.</p>
                    
                    <p>I figured out a path out of all of that. And, along with Max and Benjamin - who both have incredibly similar and incredibly different stories in different ways - we’d love nothing more than to help others do the same.</p>
                        
                    <p>Our hypothesis, frankly, is that fulfilled people who feel heard and appreciated and important are way less likely to F*#$ up the world. And of course, what a wonderful treat it will be to help people individually as well!</p>

                    <p>As it turns out, people in tech wield a LOT of power. So let’s focus that power toward good! Together!</p>

                    <h2>The Frontstory</h2>

                    <p><em>For Human Sake</em> is a community built around vulnerability, teamwork, and shared accomplishment. We’re a community that actually FEELS like a community. That is, we care about each other and we are invested in each other's success. How? We do few things differently.</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Participation is required. If you stop participating you get kicked out.</li>
                        <li>Helping others is required. Whether personal or professional, we’re all working on things. All community members are required to be participating in at least one project that isn't "their baby."</li>
                        <li>1-on-1s are required. We do some fancy matchmaking to introduce you to new people <strong>1-on-1</strong>. Because, as much as our Twitter profiles want to object, 1-to-many communication is barely communication at all.</li>
                        <li>We will accomplish things together. From promoting equality to losing a few pounds, we will change the world and ourselves together.</li>
                        <li>We will listen first. THIS IS A SAFE SPACE. And that can only be true if we are respectful of ALL opinions. This does NOT mean that we need to remain neutral. But we WILL object only in ways that keep in mind the humanity of the person with the opinion. We will NOT make ANY person feel "less than". Or in other words: you are welcome here no matter who you voted for. Because togetherness starts with listening.</li>
                        <li>We will all have a voice. Every member gets a vote in the direction of this community. We co-founded <em>For Human Sake</em> because we wanted to build something TRULY together. Something big and important, and together. The irony would not be lost on us if we then got power-hungry and made all the decisions ourselves.</li>
                    </ol>
