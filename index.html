      <h3>Click a button and you'll be having a video chat within 5 minutes. 24/7. With somebody who has agreed to take vulnerability just as seriously as you. Because sometimes we just freaking need someone to talk to. About our crazy business ideas. About our existential crises. About our parents' battles with cancer.</h3>

      <h3>Online "communities" are broken. How can you jump into a room full of 700 people that you don't know and be expected to care about each other? We built FHS to be different. Based on 1-to-1 communication, you might just make REAL internet friends here. Slowly. One at a time.</h3>

      <h3>Every feeling you post is 100% anonymous unless and until you explicitly state otherwise. As you add people to your Circle of Trust, you’ll start seeing names and faces alongside feelings... but never until you’re ready. Partly because we want to encourage you to post things that you might not be ready to share with the whole world. And partly as incentive to start conversations with interesting people that you want to unmask.</h3>

      <h3>They say that misery loves company. Let's reframe that.<br/><br/><em>"People benefit from empathetic perspective."</em><br/><br/>That’s better! By listening and reading about the feelings of other people... you get to build empathy, help your fellow humans, and benefit from knowing that you are NOT the only one feeling.</h3>

      <h2>Licensed Therapy Coming Fall 2020</h2>
      <h3>Talking to peers is amazing. Especially when those peers have taken the same oath as you. That said, professional help is also amazing. So we’re partnering with licensed therapists in all 50 states (and in 2021, internationally) to bring next-level support to those that want it... while still having a completely awesome, completely unlicensed place for those who don’t.</h3>

      <h2>50% for Equity</h2>
      <h3>We spent weeks flip-flopping between non-profit or for-profit. Until one day we realized, like the stereotypical Portland residents that we are, that things don't always have to be so binary. So we’ve decided to split the difference. 50% of FHS profits will be redistributed to POC-, woman-, and trans-led NGOs working to bring equity to tech (eg <a href="http://blackgirlscode.org/">Black Girls Code</a> and <a href="http://www.latinxinai.org/">Latinx in AI</a>).</h3>

      <h2>Empathy Starts with Listening</h2>
      <h3><strong>ALL</strong> tech workers are welcome here. Obviously this includes all races, sexes, genders, and religions. Less obviously... you are welcome here no matter who you voted for. Because people are people. Because isolating ourselves in our bubbles is not a way to grow empathy. That said... empathy is not endorsement. Working to <em>understand</em> someone is not the same thing as working to <em>agree</em> with someone. And empathy is not staying quiet. We won’t be shy about pushing our liberal agenda... but we will not do so in a way that makes a single person feel "less than".</h3>
